# R & D

This is the github repo for the AUT & Air New Zealand R & D Project.

Inside are a collection of scripts and programs which we have worked on over the year.

The most notable programs exist inside of the Graphing/ directory as this is the directory where all of the software was placed in relation to our most up to date and final goals.

Inside this folder there will be API keys and references to AWS credential files which are owned by one of the members of the project team.

The main handover files exist inside of the Graphing/application Directory where the python graphql website lives.

There is also a nodejs graphql implementation.
A weather chatbot and a watson language translator chatbot.
ParlAI is a open source tool created to help conversationalists build chatbot.
